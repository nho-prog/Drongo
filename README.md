# Introduction
  This project involves developing an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) in C. It is assumed that you are comfortable programming in C on a *NIX type of operating system. We will be using git to version control our source code artefacts
 ##Setting up the development environment
   Following instructions assume that you are working on an Ubuntu machine, and are in the sudoers group (or have root access).
   ## Required tools
   
  1. An IDE. You should use either https://code.visualstudio.com or https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/ for writing and debugging your code.
  
  2.Postman for easily testing the HTTP endpoints.
  
  3.git for working with version control repositories. You can install the git client by running sudo apt install git in a shell.
  
  ## Installing essential libraries that you will need
  
 1. Open a shell and run sudo apt update

 2.Ensure that you have installed the essential headers and libraries: sudo apt install build-essential

 3.You can write unit tests for all your C code using munit. NOTE: We will start with writing the unit tests via simple hand-crafter test functions, and then later move to something like munit.

 4.Install Kore Web framework as  describe here https://docs.kore.io/4.1.0/install.html. You will use it to write an HTTP endpoint for receiving the requests for the ESB. NOTE: A skeleton is provided to get you started. However, you are strongly encouraged to go through the Kore's simple guide.

        The above structure was generated by running kodev create esb_app in the directory ~/temp/esb_proj. Some of the default files were suitably edited to create the skeleton code which is provided to you here. You can compare the generated files to see what we have changed and added.
        
  ## Creating a workspace with the sample code
        
   you can execute the following steps on a shell (on Ubuntu):
#Install required libraries
sudo apt update

sudo apt install build-essential

sudo apt install libssl-dev

sudo apt install wget

sudo apt install curl

#Download the kodev sources

wget https://kore.io/releases/kore-4.1.0.tar.gz

tar -xf kore-4.1.0.tar.gz

cd kore-4.1.0/

#Build and install kodev

make

sudo make install

#Change directories into a working folder

cd /path/to/where/you/want/to/work

#Name 'esb_app' is important, because we will be copying the files from this repo

kodev create esb_app

#Fetch the code from this repositiry

git clone https://github.com/nho2020/esb_proj.git

#Copy only the relevant files from cloned repo into your kodev created one

cp -r esb_proj/esb_app/src/* esb_app/src/

cp -r esb_proj/esb_app/conf/* esb_app/conf/

#Build and run the kodev application

cd esb_app/

kodev build

kodev run

Open another shell window and run: curl --insecure -F "bmd_file=@/some/file/path/dummy_data.txt" https://localhost:8888/bmd

Check the logs in first shell; it should show that the file was successfully received
