# Introduction
  This project involves developing an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) in C. It is assumed that you are comfortable programming in C on a *NIX type of operating system. We will be using git to version control our source code artefacts
 ##Setting up the development environment
   Following instructions assume that you are working on an Ubuntu machine, and are in the sudoers group (or have root access).
   ###Required tools
  1. An IDE. You should use either @https://code.visualstudio.com or @https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/ for writing and debugging your code.
  2.Postman for easily testing the HTTP endpoints.
  3.git for working with version control repositories. You can install the git client by running sudo apt install git in a shell.
